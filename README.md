# GYFEx - Get Your Freaking Electives' Extension

GYFEx (Get Your Freaking Electives' Extension) is a lightweight, privacy-focused browser extension inspired by [GYFE](https://github.com/metakgp/gyfe). Some users, who don't feel comfortable entering credentials in the [GYFE Website](https://gyfe.metakgp.org), can try out this browser extension that requires no credentials. Still, I highly encourage you to use [GYFE](https://gyfe.metakgp.org), which lets you download excel files for both depth and breadth, along with subjects to pursue a minor.

## Features

- **No Login Required**: Use important features as GYFE without entering credentials.
